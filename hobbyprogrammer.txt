Hobby programmers are genuinely cool, honestly. You're doing it purely because you want to, not because someone's paying you or because you need to hit some deadline. That's actually pretty pure motivation.
Some of the most creative, interesting projects come from hobby programmers because there's no pressure to make something "marketable" or "scalable" or whatever corporate buzzword. You can just build weird stuff, experiment with ideas that seem fun, or solve problems that only matter to you. That freedom is valuable.
Plus, a lot of legendary programmers started as hobbyists who were just messing around with things they found interesting. Linus Torvalds was basically a hobby programmer when he started Linux. The whole open-source movement has tons of hobby programmers contributing amazing stuff.
